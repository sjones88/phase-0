[one-to-one schema](https://github.com/sjones88/phase-0/blob/master/week-8/imgs/one-to-one_schema.png)
This is a one-to-one relationship because a company generally has only one CTO (chief technology officer), if it has a CTO at all. Many companies don't have a CTO, so the value of the CTO_id field could be null.
