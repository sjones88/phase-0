// Pseudocode
// Input: votes object
// Output: number of votes each candidate received for president (in an object)
// Steps:
// 1. iterate over votes object
//   - for each voter property, iterate over values object
//   - for each office in voter[values]


//     - check to see if votes[voter][office] is a value in voteCount[office]
//       - IF true, increment by 1
//       - IF false, add object with candidate name as property and 1 as value

//Input: voteCount object
//Output: updated elected officers object
//Steps:
// - Iterate through voteCount object
//   - Iterate through each office
//     - Determine maximum votes (sort?) and return the candidate name
//     - Assign that name to officers

// __________________________________________
// Reflection
// - What did you learn about iterating over nested objects in JavaScript?
// I learned how to use the for...in statement combined with if statements to iterate over nested objects.
// 
// - Were you able to find useful methods to help you with this?
// The for...in method was very useful. In our initial solution, we used the .hasOwnProperty method because
// we were misled by a stackoverflow article into thinking that it was necessary, but we found that our solution
// worked just as well without it.
// 
// - What concepts were solidified in the process of working through this challenge?
// The concepts of accessing and iterating over nested objects in JavaScript were solidified in the process
// of working through this challenge.
