## What does open source mean?: ##

'Open source' means that anyone can access or contribute to a project for free.

#### What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia? ####

It depends. For commercial projects, open source obviously doesn't make sense. However, open source has made many projects possible that would have been impractical as private endeavors, and innovations that have come out of the open source community have contributed to many commercial projects. Sometimes the sheer volume of information that's available for free on the internet makes open source feel like a utopian fantasy. However, the growing open source movement can make your inner capitalist shudder.

## Assess the importance of using licenses. ##

Licenses are important because they define the ways that users can modify, distribute, and, generally, use software. A well-drafted license protects copyright holders' intellectual property and protects users from the arbitrary actions of litigious developers.
