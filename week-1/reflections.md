## 1.1 Think About Time ##

I learned about flow, meditation, and the pomodoro technique.
Time boxing:
	Time boxing is the practice of working steadily towards a predetermined goal for a specified period of time. Time boxing is similar to the pomodoro technique: instead of working on a task through to completion, you work on a task for a period of time (25 minutes, in the case of the pomodoro technique) and then take a short break to reflect on what you've accomplished. Some research has demonstrated that timeboxed working techniques can increase productivity and reduce frustration.
Current time management habits:
	My habit has been to work continuously on a task until I feel the need for a break. Usually I need a break when I realize I have been sitting for an extended period of time and I need to stretch or I'm just mentally worn out from focusing on a tough problem. Time boxing techniques supposedly reduce the kind of fatigue that I'm used to experiencing when I focus on a task for an extended period of time, so I will definitely try those techniques as I'm working through the material in Phase 0. Specifically, I plan to apply the pomodoro technique by breaking up my working time into 25 minute blocks separated by 5 minute blocks for reflection on my progress. After using this technique for a few days, I will evaluate my productivity to see if the technique is (1) increasing my productivity and (2) reducing my work-related stress.

## 1.2 The Command Line ##

Git is a popular version control system, and GitHub is the website that serves as a GUI extension of Git. When handling the actual code of a Git-based project, developers interact with Git through the command line interface - not through the GitHub website or app.

Version control systems allow multiple users to track changes they've made to a project without unintentionally altering the original project file. Users can download the latest project files and modify their copies of those files without changing the originals. GitHub helps by organizing a project in a tree-like model. The code base is the "trunk," and users can create 'branches' by uploading their modified files. A commit is created when a user uploads changed files to Git.
