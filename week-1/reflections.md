## 1.1 Think About Time ##

I learned about flow, meditation, and the pomodoro technique.
Time boxing:
	Time boxing is the practice of working steadily towards a predetermined goal for a specified period of time. Time boxing is similar to the pomodoro technique: instead of working on a task through to completion, you work on a task for a period of time (25 minutes, in the case of the pomodoro technique) and then take a short break to reflect on what you've accomplished. Some research has demonstrated that timeboxed working techniques can increase productivity and reduce frustration.
Current time management habits:
	My habit has been to work continuously on a task until I feel the need for a break. Usually I need a break when I realize I have been sitting for an extended period of time and I need to stretch or I'm just mentally worn out from focusing on a tough problem. Time boxing techniques supposedly reduce the kind of fatigue that I'm used to experiencing when I focus on a task for an extended period of time, so I will definitely try those techniques as I'm working through the material in Phase 0. Specifically, I plan to apply the pomodoro technique by breaking up my working time into 25 minute blocks separated by 5 minute blocks for reflection on my progress. After using this technique for a few days, I will evaluate my productivity to see if the technique is (1) increasing my productivity and (2) reducing my work-related stress.

## 1.2 The Command Line ##

CLI reflection:
What is a shell? What is bash?
	A shell is a text-based interface through which a user can pass commands to a computer's operating system. Bash is a specific type of Unix shell.
Biggest challenge?
	At first I found it challenging to memorize the list of basic commands, but after a bit of practice with them, memorization has become less of an issue. I have been able to successfully use and understand most of the basic commands, but the list of arguments/operands associated with each command is quite daunting.
Most important commands and arguments?
	The commands for navigating around the file system and creating and deleting files and directories are probably the most important to learn first (e.g. pwd, ls, mv, cd, mkdir, rmdir, rm).
pwd - print working directory. This prints the current directory (or folder) to the shell.
ls - lists the contents of the current directory
mv - moves files or directories
cd - change directory
../ - selects all parent directories
touch - creates a new empty file
mkdir - creates a new directory within the working directory
less - displays the content of a text file in pages
rmdir - deletes an empty directory
rm - deletes a file
help (man) - displays the manual for a given command
