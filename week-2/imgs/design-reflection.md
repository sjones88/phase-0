### What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?:
The purpose of my site is to provide information about me to a wide audience including potential employers, collaborators, and anyone who might be curious about my work. With this purpose in mind, content should include links to my social networks (espeically LinkedIn and GitHub), a link to my GitHub blog, an 'About Me' page, contact information, and information about my current and past projects and education.

### What are your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?:
The most important segment of my target audience - potential employers - will be interested in determining whether or not to hire me as a software developer. My site will address them by providing all of the relevant content listed above in an attractive way that showcases my new skills as a developer.

### What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.:
There should be three primary 'actions' the user should take when visiting the site: find information about me, view my portfolio, and contact me.

### What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?:
User experience (UX) is how people feel as they are interacting with software. The user experience is heavily influenced - but not dictated - by the design of the user interface. Because design is so central to UX, developers should be careful to consider UX and not just their clients' or their own tastes when designing user interfaces.

### Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?:
I didn't find the challenge to be particularly tedious, but if I had to choose, I would say finding a suitable web app for making the site map was a bit tedious.
