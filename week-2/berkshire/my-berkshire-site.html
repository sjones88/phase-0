<!-- Reflection:
- It was fun! It's hilarious that a company whose stock trades at over $100,000 per share has a website that a beginner can rebuild in a matter of minutes.

- I actually didn't use semantic HTML5 elements. I used divs to organize my page.

- It was pretty easy to avoid formatting because the Berkshire website has so little of it.

- The good: the HTML core of a website is a simple framework that's easy to organize and understand. The bad: HTML by itself can't be used to create visually pleasing websites. I'm looking forward to learning about CSS.

- I haven't really developed any 'tricks' yet. The kind of practice we did in this exercise helps with memorization.
