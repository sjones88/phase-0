### What is a wireframe?
A wireframe is a simple sketch of the layout of a web page. It does not contain any of the content of the page - only the basic elements of the page, like the header, footer, text boxes, sidebar, buttons, and so on.

### What are the benefits of wireframing?
When you prepare to write an essay, one of the first things you do is organize your ideas into an outline. A wireframe is like an outline of a website. It's an outline or map of where your content will reside on the page that you can use as a guide when you're writing the code.

### Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
I did enjoy wireframing my site. It's fun to think about how things to should fit together on the page, even if the final product will be quite simple.

### Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
I played around with the layout as I went along, so, in that sense, I did revise my wireframe.

### What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
I had questions about what tools were available for free. I found a [list](http://mashable.com/2010/07/15/wireframing-tools/#D0L8tTS4Pgqt) of free wireframing tools at mashable.com, and I wound up using Mockingbird.

### Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
I enjoyed using Mockingbird. It's an intuitive and beginner-friendly app and, thankfully, using it was not tedious.
